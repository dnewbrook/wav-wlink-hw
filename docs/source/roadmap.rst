Roadmap / Future Plans
========================
While Wlink has a bunch of infrastructure in place already, we have just begun to see what it possible. Listed
here are several items we plan to or are currently developing.

* TileLink Applicaiton Layer
* AMBA ATB Application Layer
* Ability to expose Wlink Link Layer Interfaces to the top of Wlink
  
  * Would allow users to create their own Flow Control blocks

* sbt test setup for large regressions of various Wlink designs
* Integration into Chipyard for rapid SoC development
* PHY Wrapper that would support a subset of PIPE
* Extending Wlink Nodes for NoC development

* Topology-aware link layer components
* Packet coat-tailing for increased bandwidth
